# Grocery Sales Analysis Dashboard
**Description:**

This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize grocery sales data from BlinkIt. The dashboard provides insights into various metrics related to item sales, store performance, and customer preferences. It helps in understanding sales trends, product performance, and store characteristics.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of sales data for grocery items, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. The dashboard is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, offering actionable insights through various visualizations.
